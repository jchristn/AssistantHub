Make it part of your plan.\\nPractice mindfulness: Engage in deep breathing, meditation, or stretching to manage stress and improve focus.\\nHydrate: Drinking enough water is crucial for maintaining overall health and proper bodily functions. Water plays a vital role in regulating body temperature, lubricating joints, transporting nutrients, protecting organs, increasing calorie burning, and is necessary to burn fat. Dehydration can significantly impact energy levels, causing fatigue and lethargy. Drink at least 64 oz a day!\\n4\\nSelf Care Tips and Tricks - Staying Healthy during Holidays\\nStay active:\\nDon\\u2019t skip that workout! It\\u2019ll help you be more productive. MOVEMENT = ENERGY!\\nHow Exercise Boosts Energy: Improves oxygen circulation: Exercise increases blood flow and oxygen delivery to muscles, providing them with more energy.

Improves sleep quality: Regular exercise can lead to better sleep, which is essential for feeling refreshed and energized. Increases mitochondrial function: Mitochondria are the energy-producing organelles in cells. Exercise can improve mitochondrial function, leading to more efficient energy production. Reduces stress: Exercise can help reduce stress levels, which can contribute to feelings of fatigue.\\n5\\nSelf Care Tips and Tricks - Staying Healthy during Holidays\\nStay on Track during those big Holiday Dinners\\n1. Don\\u2019t skip breakfast! Break your fast and kick start your metabolism. This helps stabilize blood sugar levels, prevent pre-dinner cravings and overeating at dinner. Also, studies show that people who skip meals on holidays end up eating more calories overall than those who eat breakfast \\u0026 lunch at their regular times.\\n2. Drink LOTS of water! Especially right before and after your big holiday meal Enhanced Digestive Efficiency Drinking water before meals primes your digestive system for optimal performance. It helps produce adequate stomach acid and digestive enzymes, ensuring proper breakdown of foods. This preparatory hydration also helps prevent digestive issues like constipation and bloating, demonstrating just one of the 100 benefits of drinking water when timed correctly around meals. Weight Management Support One of the most significant benefits of drinking water before meals is its impact on weight management. Studies have shown that pre-meal water consumption can reduce caloric intake by creating a feeling of fullness,\\n6\\nSelf Care Tips and Tricks - Staying Healthy during Holidays\\nmaking drinking water to lose weight an effective strategy. This natural appetite suppression can help control portion sizes and support long-term weight management goals.. Improved Nutrient Absorption Proper hydration after meals aids in the efficient transportation of nutrients throughout your body. The importance of water in the body becomes particularly evident during the digestive process, as water helps break down food and facilitates the absorption of nutrients through the intestinal walls, ensuring maximum benefit from your meals. Metabolic Boost Water consumption around meals can increase your metabolic rate, supporting better calorie burning and energy utilization. This metabolic enhancement is one of the key health benefits of drinking water, as it helps maintain a healthy weight while ensuring optimal body function and energy levels throughout the day. Toxin Elimination Regular water intake before and after meals helps flush toxins from your system more effectively. This cleansing effect supports kidney function and helps maintain a healthy digestive tract, demonstrating why the benefits of drinking more water extend beyond simple hydration to overall body cleansing and maintenance.\\n7\\nSelf Care Tips and Tricks - Staying Healthy during Holidays\\n3. Use a smaller plate Going for a second plate is totally understandable on this delicious holiday! Use a smaller plate for portion control. If there are no smaller plates available you can use the inner rim of a bigger plate.\\n4. Avoid certain parts of a dish Enjoy the turkey, but avoid the skin. Enjoy those mashed sweet potatoes, but scrape off the marshmallow. Enjoy that salad, but remove the croutons.\\n5. Eat slowly and mindfully - (grazing, smaller plate) In general, it takes 20 minutes for our body to feel full once we\\u2019ve started eating. If you eat too fast you may overeat because you aren\\u2019t yet aware that you are full. Eating too fast may also cause us to take bites way too big or not chew enough. Chewing your food properly and thoroughly can help in smooth digestion and nutrient absorption. When you don\\u0027t chew your food enough, the rest of your digestive system becomes confused. Your body may not produce enough of the enzymes needed to fully break down your food. This could lead to digestive problems, like bloating and constipation.\\n8\\nSelf Care Tips and Tricks - Staying Healthy during Holidays\\nOne of my favorite hacks, not just for big holiday dinners but eating in general, is putting down the fork every 3 bites\\u2026 Take a break, look up from your plate \\u0026 around the table, talk, engage, be in the moment.\\n6. Prioritize your veggies and protein Make sure you\\u2019re getting your necessary nutrients before indulging and getting full on the \\u201Cbad\\u201D stuff. This will also help you eat less unnecessary carbs and sweets. That doesn\\u2019t mean you can\\u2019t have those treats!\\n7. Indulge in moderation Holidays come once a year\\u2026 You don\\u2019t have to give up on your favorite dishes completely! It doesn\\u2019t have to be 0 or 100. Allowing a treat every now and then is healthy! Constantly denying your desires can later lead to overindulging. Find your balance.\\n8. Stop eating when you\\u2019re full or something is no longer enjoyable. There will probably be leftovers! The whole point of food is to nourish our bodies, not hurt it. Put down that fork if you are no longer hungry. You can always make yourself another small plate later when you\\u2019re hungry or tomorrow for lunch!\\n9\\nSelf Care Tips and Tricks - Staying Healthy during Holidays\\n9. Use the extra energy to crush your next workout What fuels energy? FOOD! When glycogen is filled, eating extra calories and carbs can play a role in making you gain weight. However, when it\\u2019s depleted, the food you eat will go to refueling your body, restoring your energy, and helping you build muscle and repair after a tough workout.\\n10. Most importantly, focus on enjoying your time with your loved ones, instead of obsessing over what you are eating. That\\u2019s what it\\u2019s all about! Enjoy the moments.\\n10\\nHEALTHY TREAT RECIPES\\nHealthy Caramel Apple Dip\\nMakes 4 servings\\nIngredients:\\n10 medjool dates (pitted) 1/2 cup hot water (more if necessary) 1/4 cup almond butter 1/2 tsp. pure vanilla extract 1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon 1-2 apples, sliced (to serve with)\\nInstructions:\\n1.

If you eat too fast you may overeat because you aren\\u2019t yet aware that you are full. Eating too fast may also cause us to take bites way too big or not chew enough. Chewing your food properly and thoroughly can help in smooth digestion and nutrient absorption. When you don\\u0027t chew your food enough, the rest of your digestive system becomes confused. Your body may not produce enough of the enzymes needed to fully break down your food. This could lead to digestive problems, like bloating and constipation.\\n8\\nSelf Care Tips and Tricks - Staying Healthy during Holidays\\nOne of my favorite hacks, not just for big holiday dinners but eating in general, is putting down the fork every 3 bites\\u2026 Take a break, look up from your plate \\u0026 around the table, talk, engage, be in the moment.\\n6. Prioritize your veggies and protein Make sure you\\u2019re getting your necessary nutrients before indulging and getting full on the \\u201Cbad\\u201D stuff. This will also help you eat less unnecessary carbs and sweets. That doesn\\u2019t mean you can\\u2019t have those treats!\\n7. Indulge in moderation Holidays come once a year\\u2026 You don\\u2019t have to give up on your favorite dishes completely! It doesn\\u2019t have to be 0 or 100. Allowing a treat every now and then is healthy! Constantly denying your desires can later lead to overindulging. Find your balance.\\n8. Stop eating when you\\u2019re full or something is no longer enjoyable. There will probably be leftovers! The whole point of food is to nourish our bodies, not hurt it. Put down that fork if you are no longer hungry. You can always make yourself another small plate later when you\\u2019re hungry or tomorrow for lunch!\\n9\\nSelf Care Tips and Tricks - Staying Healthy during Holidays\\n9. Use the extra energy to crush your next workout What fuels energy? FOOD! When glycogen is filled, eating extra calories and carbs can play a role in making you gain weight. However, when it\\u2019s depleted, the food you eat will go to refueling your body, restoring your energy, and helping you build muscle and repair after a tough workout.\\n10. Most importantly, focus on enjoying your time with your loved ones, instead of obsessing over what you are eating. That\\u2019s what it\\u2019s all about! Enjoy the moments.\\n10\\nHEALTHY TREAT RECIPES\\nHealthy Caramel Apple Dip\\nMakes 4 servings\\nIngredients:\\n10 medjool dates (pitted) 1/2 cup hot water (more if necessary) 1/4 cup almond butter 1/2 tsp. pure vanilla extract 1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon 1-2 apples, sliced (to serve with)\\nInstructions:\\n1.

Don\\u2019t skip breakfast! Break your fast and kick start your metabolism. This helps stabilize blood sugar levels, prevent pre-dinner cravings and overeating at dinner. Also, studies show that people who skip meals on holidays end up eating more calories overall than those who eat breakfast \\u0026 lunch at their regular times.\\n2. Drink LOTS of water! Especially right before and after your big holiday meal Enhanced Digestive Efficiency Drinking water before meals primes your digestive system for optimal performance. It helps produce adequate stomach acid and digestive enzymes, ensuring proper breakdown of foods. This preparatory hydration also helps prevent digestive issues like constipation and bloating, demonstrating just one of the 100 benefits of drinking water when timed correctly around meals. Weight Management Support One of the most significant benefits of drinking water before meals is its impact on weight management. Studies have shown that\u0022,\u0022 pre-meal water consumption can reduce caloric intake by creating a feeling of fullness,\\n6\\nSelf Care Tips and Tricks - Staying Healthy during Holidays\\nmaking drinking water to lose weight an effective strategy. This natural appetite suppression can help control portion sizes and support long-term weight management goals.. Improved Nutrient Absorption Proper hydration after meals aids in the efficient transportation of nutrients throughout your body. The importance of water in the body becomes particularly evident during the digestive process, as water helps break down food and facilitates the absorption of nutrients through the intestinal walls, ensuring maximum benefit from your meals. Metabolic Boost Water consumption around meals can increase your metabolic rate, supporting better calorie burning and energy utilization. This metabolic enhancement is one of the key health benefits of drinking water, as it helps maintain a healthy weight while ensuring optimal body function and energy levels throughout the day. Toxin Elimination Regular water intake before and after meals helps flush toxins from your system more effectively.\u0022,\u0022 This cleansing effect supports kidney function and helps maintain a healthy digestive tract, demonstrating why the benefits of drinking more water extend beyond simple hydration to overall body cleansing and maintenance.\\n7\\nSelf Care Tips and Tricks - Staying Healthy during Holidays\\n3. Use a smaller plate Going for a second plate is totally understandable on this delicious holiday! Use a smaller plate for portion control. If there are no smaller plates available you can use the inner rim of a bigger plate.\\n4. Avoid certain parts of a dish Enjoy the turkey, but avoid the skin. Enjoy those mashed sweet potatoes, but scrape off the marshmallow. Enjoy that salad, but remove the croutons.\\n5. Eat slowly and mindfully - (grazing, smaller plate) In general, it takes 20 minutes for our body to feel full once we\\u2019ve started eating. If you eat too fast you may overeat because you aren\\u2019t yet aware that you are full. Eating too fast may\u0022,\u0022 also cause us to take bites way too big or not chew enough. Chewing your food properly and thoroughly can help in smooth digestion and nutrient absorption. When you don\\u0027t chew your food enough, the rest of your digestive system becomes confused. Your body may not produce enough of the enzymes needed to fully break down your food. This could lead to digestive problems, like bloating and constipation.\\n8\\nSelf Care Tips and Tricks - Staying Healthy during Holidays\\nOne of my favorite hacks, not just for big holiday dinners but eating in general, is putting down the fork every 3 bites\\u2026 Take a break, look up from your plate \\u0026 around the table, talk, engage, be in the moment.\\n6. Prioritize your veggies and protein Make sure you\\u2019re getting your necessary nutrients before indulging and getting full on the \\u201Cbad\\u201D stuff. This will also help you eat less unnecessary carbs and sweets. That doesn\\u2019t mean you can\\u2019t have\u0022,\u0022 those treats!\\n7. Indulge in moderation Holidays come once a year\\u2026 You don\\u2019t have to give up on your favorite dishes completely! It doesn\\u2019t have to be 0 or 100. Allowing a treat every now and then is healthy! Constantly denying your desires can later lead to overindulging. Find your balance.\\n8. Stop eating when you\\u2019re full or something is no longer enjoyable. There will probably be leftovers! The whole point of food is to nourish our bodies, not hurt it. Put down that fork if you are no longer hungry. You can always make yourself another small plate later when you\\u2019re hungry or tomorrow for lunch!\\n9\\nSelf Care Tips and Tricks - Staying Healthy during Holidays\\n9. Use the extra energy to crush your next workout What fuels energy? FOOD! When glycogen is filled, eating extra calories and carbs can play a role in making you gain weight. However, when it\u0022,\u0022\\u2019s depleted, the food you eat will go to refueling your body, restoring your energy, and helping you build muscle and repair after a tough workout.\\n10. Most importantly, focus on enjoying your time with your loved ones, instead of obsessing over what you are eating. That\\u2019s what it\\u2019s all about! Enjoy the moments.\\n10\\nHEALTHY TREAT RECIPES\\nHealthy Caramel Apple Dip\\nMakes 4 servings\\nIngredients:\\n10 medjool dates (pitted) 1/2 cup hot water (more if necessary) 1/4 cup almond butter 1/2 tsp. pure vanilla extract 1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon 1-2 apples, sliced (to serve with)\\nInstructions:\\n1.
