This Agreement is incorporated into the existing agreements between Company and Contractor regarding Contractor\\u2019s services to Company, Company\\u2019s clients, and any other aspect of the relationship between Company and Contractor. The parties intend this Agreement to be consistent with any existing agreements between them. But unless specified otherwise in this Agreement, this Agreement takes precedence over any inconsistent term in any existing agreement between the parties. If any term of this Agreement conflicts with an existing agreement between the parties, this Agreement controls. The parties agree as follows:\\n1. Intent to Arbitrate. (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 6, Contractor and Company agree to first attempt to resolve any disputes or claims amicably and on an individual basis by providing 30 days written notice prior to filing any such dispute or claim. If the dispute or claim is not resolved amicably, and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Contractor and Company agree that to the fullest extent permitted by law, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES OR CLAIMS BETWEEN CONTRACTOR AND COMPANY will be exclusively resolved by final and binding arbitration by a neutral arbitrator, including without limitation any and all disputes or claims BETWEEN CONTRACTOR AND COMPANY, whether in contract, tort, statute, or otherwise, arising out of or relating to the formation (including unconscionability and invalidity), existence, breach, termination, interpretation, enforcement, validity, scope, and applicability of this Agreement, Contractor\\u2019s classification as an independent contractor, or Contractor\\u2019s engagement with Company, or any claim on any basis under federal, state, or local law, which could otherwise be heard before any court of competent jurisdiction arising out of or relating to this Agreement, Contractor\\u2019s classification as an independent contractor, or Contractor\\u2019s engagement with Company. By signing this Agreement, and unless otherwise stated in this Agreement, Contractor and Company hereby waive their right to have any covered dispute, claim, or controversy decided by a judge or jury in a court. Contractor and Company also understand and agree that Company\\u2019s business and Contractor\\u2019s services involve commerce under the Federal Arbitration Act. This Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \\u00A7\\u00A7 1 et seq.) even if Company and Contractor are otherwise exempted from the FAA. Any disputes or claims in this regard must be resolved exclusively by an arbitrator. In the event, but only in the event, there is a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that the FAA does not apply, the Delaware Uniform Arbitration Act will apply. Contractor and Company anticipate that by entering into this Agreement, the Parties will gain the benefits of a speedy and less expensive dispute resolution procedure. This Agreement shall encompass all disputes and claims that Company may have against Contractor, or that Contractor may have against Company and/or any of its officers, directors, employees, owners, agents, representatives, benefit plans, sponsors, fiduciaries, parents, subsidiaries, or affiliated entities (each of which may enforce this Agreement as a third party beneficiary, in addition to the third parties described in Section 4 below) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, Contractor\\u2019s classification as an independent contractor, or Contractor\\u2019s engagement with Company. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7, Contractor and Company agree that any third party at or in whose premises the Services under this Agreement may be performed, as well as any consumer reporting agency responsible for providing background check services of Contractor, are intended third party beneficiaries of this Agreement. For additional clarity, by signing this Agreement, Contractor and Company hereby expressly waive, to the extent permitted by applicable law, their right to have any dispute or claim resolved by a court unless specifically set out in this Agreement.\\n2. Delegation. Except as this Agreement otherwise provides, the arbitrability of any dispute between Contractor and Company, including whether or to what extent all or part of this Agreement is invalid, unconscionable, or otherwise unenforceable, and whether a dispute, claim, or controversy is\\nDoc ID: 2a05783083fc8596a06cca54d66070d96995218d\\nsubject to arbitration, is a decision that will be submitted exclusively to the arbitrator, and will not be decided by any federal or state court. Contractor and Company intend this delegation clause to be clear and unmistakable evidence of Contractor and Company\\u2019s agreement to delegate these issues to the arbitrator, subject to the exceptions stated in the Sections 5 and 6, which set forth that this delegation clause shall not apply to the Waiver of Class Action Claims and Waiver of Representative Action Claims.\\n3. Covered Claims. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the disputes and claims covered by this Agreement include any and all disputes and claims BETWEEN CONTRACTOR AND COMPANY arising out of or relating to this Agreement, Contractor\\u2019s classification as an independent contractor, or Contractor\\u2019s engagement with Company, which could otherwise be heard before a court of competent jurisdiction (a \\u201CClaim\\u201D), including but not limited to disputes or claims related to allegations of wrongful termination; breach of any contract or covenant, express or implied; breach of any duty owed to Contractor by Company or to Company by Contractor; personal, physical or emotional injury (excluding benefit claims covered under any applicable workers\\u2019-compensation law); fraud, misrepresentation, defamation, and any other tort claims; wages or other compensation due; penalties; benefits; reimbursement of expenses; discrimination or harassment, including but not limited to discrimination or harassment based on race, sex, color, pregnancy, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, or sexual orientation; retaliation; violation of any local, state, or federal constitution, statute, law, ordinance or regulation (as originally enacted and as amended), including but not limited to Fair Credit Reporting Act, Defend Trade Secrets Act, 42 U.S.C. \\u00A71981, Rehabilitation Act, Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1871, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, Equal Pay Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, Americans With Disabilities Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (except for claims for employee benefits under any benefit plan sponsored by Company and (a) covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or (b) funded by insurance), Affordable Care Act, Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act, Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, Older Workers Benefits Protection Act of 1990, Occupational Safety and Health Act, Immigration Reform and Control Act, Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, Family and Medical Leave Act, False Claims Act, and all other federal, state, or local statutory and legal claims arising out of or relating to Contractor\\u2019s relationship with Company (including without limitation misclassification claims) or the termination of that relationship (including without limitation torts and post-termination defamation or retaliation).\\nThis includes all claims that arose before the signing of this or any prior Agreement and any claims that may arise after the signing or termination of this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in Section 7. Covered Claims also include Third-Party Disputes as defined in Section 4.\\nA Claim under this Section also includes all claims or disputes between Contractor and any third party arising out of or related to the Services performed under this Agreement that may be brought against third party at or in whose premises the Services under this Agreement may be performed. A Claim also includes all claims or disputes between Contractor and a third party concerning the provision of any background check of Contractor by a consumer reporting agency. Any disputes or claims in this regard shall be resolved exclusively by an arbitrator.\\nA Claim arising under any law that requires resort to an administrative agency shall be brought before such agency as required by law, and that after exhaustion of administrative remedies, the Claim must be pursued through this binding arbitration procedure to the fullest extent permitted by law.\\nContractor agrees that each Claim covered under this Section must proceed in arbitration (except as otherwise provided in Sections 5, 6, and 7) even if the Claim is included or pleaded in the same\\nDoc ID: 2a05783083fc8596a06cca54d66070d96995218d\\ncomplaint, case, or proceeding with a dispute or claim that is not covered by this Agreement as described in Section 7.\\n4. Application to Third Parties. This Arbitration Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall include, any dispute, controversy, or claim brought by or against any third parties where the underlying claims arise out of or relate to this Agreement, Contractor\\u2019s classification as an independent contractor, or Contractor\\u2019s engagement with Company (\\u201CThird Party Disputes\\u201D). Third Party Disputes include any dispute, controversy, or claim against: (1) any business partners or contracting parties of Company; (2) any clients of Company; and (3) Company\\u2019s vendors and service providers including without limitation: (a) payment processors; (b) identity verification vendors; (c) any third party involved in the provision of any background check of Contractor by a consumer reporting agency; and (d) other partners assisting in fraud prevention. Third Party Disputes shall also include any dispute, controversy, or claim by or against Contractor\\u2019s spouses, heirs, third-party beneficiaries, and assigns. For avoidance of doubt, a Claim under this Agreement includes all claims or disputes between Contractor and third party arising out of or related to the services performed by Contractor in the course of Contractor\\u2019s engagement with Company. Any disputes or claims in this regard shall be resolved exclusively by an arbitrator, and the Parties agree that third parties described in Section 4 are third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement and have the right to enforce this Agreement (including but not limited to filing a motion to compel arbitration) for Third Party Disputes.\\n5. Waiver of Class Action Claims. By signing this Agreement, Company and Contractor agree that each may bring and pursue claims against the other only in their individual capacities, and may not bring, pursue, or act as a plaintiff, class representative, or class member in any purported class or collective proceeding or action. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the applicable arbitration rules under the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution (\\u201CCPR\\u201D) or ADR Services, Inc. (as described below): (1) Any claim that all or part of this Waiver of Class Action Claims is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable shall be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) If the waiver set forth in this Section is found to be unenforceable, any class or collective action claims will be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction and not as a class or collective arbitration; and (3) If applicable law permits a party to elect to invalidate the waiver set forth in this Section as to certain types of claims, and such party\\u2019s election renders the waiver set forth in this Section unenforceable as to such claims, any class or collective action for such claims will be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction and not as a class or collective arbitration.\\n6. Waiver of Representative Action Claims. By signing this Agreement, Company and Contractor agree that each may bring and pursue claims against the other only in their individual capacities, and may not bring, pursue, or act as a plaintiff or representative in any purported representative proceeding or action or otherwise participate in any such representative proceeding or action. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the applicable arbitration rules under CPR or ADR Services, Inc. (as described below): (1) Any claim that all or part of this Waiver of Representative Action Claims is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable shall be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (2) If all or part of the waiver set forth in this Section is found to be unenforceable, any representative action claims will be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction and not as a representative arbitration, but any arbitrable individual portion of any representative action shall be arbitrated under Section 9 of this Agreement.\\n7. Claims Not Covered. This Agreement does not apply to litigation between Contractor (as a party or actual or prospective class member) and Company pending in a state or federal court or arbitration as of the effective date of Contractor\\u2019s receipt of this Agreement. Claims not covered by this\\nDoc ID: 2a05783083fc8596a06cca54d66070d96995218d\\nAgreement are claims for workers\\u2019 compensation benefits; claims for unemployment compensation benefits; or any other claims that as a matter of controlling law cannot proceed in arbitration, provided that controlling law is not preempted by the FAA. For claims alleging a sexual harassment dispute or sexual assault dispute as defined by 9 U.S.C. \\u00A7\\u00A7 401 and 402, if the party alleging such claims elects to proceed with such claims in court instead of arbitration (\\u201CElectable Claims\\u201D): (1) upon a valid and timely election by the party to not proceed in arbitration for such Electable Claims, such Electable Claims may be litigated in a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction and need not proceed in arbitration; and (2) if an Electable Claim is included or pleaded in the same complaint, case, or proceeding with other Covered Claims that do not allege conduct constituting a sexual harassment dispute or a sexual assault dispute (\\u201CNon-Electable Claims\\u201D), that shall not prevent the Non-Electable Claims from being severed from the Electable Claims and proceeding in arbitration pursuant to this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement prohibits Contractor from exercising rights protected under the National Labor Relations Act or from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, Securities and Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board, or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. Nothing in this Agreement prevents the investigation by a government agency of any report, claim, or charge otherwise covered by this Agreement. Disputes or claims between Company and any third-party beneficiaries are not covered by the terms of this Agreement.\\n8. Arbitration Procedures and Forum. Except as described below for Contractors providing Services in California, by signing this Agreement, Contractor and Company further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted before one neutral arbitrator selected by the Parties as provided by the CPR Administered Arbitration Rules (https://drs.cpradr.org/rules/arbitration/administered-arbitration-rules-2019) and, if applicable, the CPR Employment-Related Mass-Claims Protocol (https://static.cpradr.org/docs/ERMCP-2021.pdf) (collectively, the \\u201CCPR Rules\\u201D).

If CPR is not available to hear the matter in dispute, Contractor and Company shall confer and agree upon a mutually agreeable arbitral forum. The unavailability of CPR or any other arbitral forum shall not be a basis to invalidate the Parties\\u2019 agreement to arbitrate. If for any reason Contractor and Company cannot agree to an arbitral forum, either party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction with authority over the location where the arbitration will be conducted for appointment of a neutral arbitrator.\\n9. California Contractor Arbitration Rules.

If ADR Services is not available to hear the matter in dispute, Contractor and Company will confer and agree upon a mutually agreeable arbitral forum. The unavailability of ADR Services or any other arbitral forum is not a basis to invalidate the Parties\\u2019 agreement to arbitrate. If for any reason Contractor and Company cannot agree to an arbitral forum, either party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction with authority over the location where the arbitration will be conducted for appointment of a neutral arbitrator.\\nDoc ID: 2a05783083fc8596a06cca54d66070d96995218d\\n10. Location. The arbitration shall be held in the United States county where Contractor lives or performs services or in any other location Contractor and Company agree upon in writing.\\n11. Arbitration Fees, Attorney\\u2019s Fees, and Costs. Contractor and Company will follow the CPR Rules or ADR Services Rules applicable to initial filing fees, but in no event will Contractor be responsible for any portion of those fees in excess of the filing or initial appearance fees applicable to court actions in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be conducted. After Contractor pays Contractor\\u2019s portion of any initial filing fee, Company must pay any remaining portion of the initial fee and must also pay all costs and expenses unique to arbitration, including, without limitation, the arbitrator\\u2019s fees and any of CPR or ADR Services Inc.\\u2019s arbitration administrative expenses. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, \\u201Carbitration fees\\u201D) will be governed by the applicable CPR Rules or ADR Services Rules and the laws of the jurisdiction in which Contractor performed Services. In all cases required by law, Company will pay the full amount of the arbitration fees. Any disputes in that regard will be resolved by the arbitrator as soon as practicable after the arbitrator is selected, and Company will bear all of the arbitration fees until such time as the arbitrator resolves any such dispute. Contractor may be represented by counsel during any arbitration proceeding. Each party will pay its own costs and attorney\\u2019s fees, subject to the arbitrator\\u2019s ability, described in Section 12, to award costs and attorney\\u2019s fees to the extent such a remedy would have been available to the parties had the matter been heard in a court.\\n12. Awards. The arbitrator is authorized to award only those remedies or relief available under applicable law and that the arbitrator deems just and equitable, including any remedy or relief that would have been available to the parties had the matter been heard in a court, except that this Section 12 does not encompass, permit, or authorize any remedy or relief awarded on a class-wide, collective, or representative basis. The decision of the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall provide the findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the award unless Contractor and Company agree otherwise.\\n13. Provisional Relief. Contractor or Company may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy in accordance with applicable law, but only upon the ground that the award to which the applicant may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual without provisional relief and there is insufficient time to seek such provisional relief in arbitration. And any such application may not be deemed incompatible with or a waiver of this agreement to arbitrate, and preliminary relief sought in such application is subject to and limited by Sections 4 and 5. The court to which the application is made is authorized to consider the merits of the arbitrable controversy to the extent it deems necessary in making its ruling, but only to the extent permitted by applicable law. All determinations of final relief, however, will be decided in arbitration.\\n14. Opt-Out for Agreement.\\n(a) Contractor has 30 calendar days from the date Contractor signs this Agreement to opt-out of the Agreement. However, opting-out of this Agreement does not affect any other part of this Agreement. If Contractor opts out of the Agreement, then neither Contractor nor Company will be bound by the terms of this Agreement. Should Contractor not opt out in accordance with this Section 14 within the 30-day period, then this Agreement will become fully effective and binding as of the date the Agreement is executed by Contractor. If Contractor agreed to a previous arbitration agreement with Company and opts out of this Agreement, Contractor remains bound by that prior arbitration agreement and must arbitrate any and all claims or disputes covered by that prior arbitration agreement, regardless of whether those claims or disputes arise after the date Contractor executes this Agreement.\\nDoc ID: 2a05783083fc8596a06cca54d66070d96995218d\\n(b) To opt out, within 30 days from the date Contractor signs this Agreement, Contractor must notify Company in writing of Contractor\\u2019s intent to opt-out of the Agreement by providing Contractor\\u2019s first and last name and a clear statement of Contractor\\u2019s intent to opt out such as \\u201CI wish to opt-out of the Agreement\\u201D or words to that effect. The written intent to opt out must be provided either by: (1) sending electronic mail to legal@committedcoaches.com; or (2) by sending a letter by U.S. Mail, or by any nationally recognized delivery service (e.g. Federal Express, UPS), or delivered by hand to:\\nP.O. Box 4573 El Dorado Hills 95762\\n(c) In order to be effective, the letter under option (2) must be dated and signed by Contractor and the envelope containing the signed letter must be received (if delivered by hand) or post-marked within 30 days of the date you sign this Agreement. Contractor\\u2019s written intent to opt-out of the Agreement, whether sent by (1) or (2), will be maintained by Company, and Contractor is encouraged to retain a copy for Contractor\\u2019s records.\\n15. Survival. The Agreement survives the termination of Contractor\\u2019s engagement with Company.\\n[Signature Page Follows]\\nDoc ID: 2a05783083fc8596a06cca54d66070d96995218d\\nThe parties have executed this Agreement as of the last signature date of the parties.\\nCOMPANY\\nBy: Name: Rudy Sanchez Date: 01 / 15 / 2026 CONTRACTOR\\nBy: Name: Joel Christner Date: 01 / 15 / 2026\\nDoc ID: 2a05783083fc8596a06cca54d66070d96995218d\\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND INVENTION ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT Effective Date: 01 / 15 / 2026 As a condition of becoming retained (or Contractor\\u2019s relationship being continued) by Committed 100, LLC, an Oregon corporation, or any of its current or future subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns (collectively, the \\u201CCompany\\u201D), and in consideration of Contractor\\u2019s relationship with Company and receipt of the compensation now and hereafter paid by Company, Contractor agrees to the following:\\n1.

Contractor understands that Contractor\\u2019s listing of any Inventions on Exhibit A does not constitute an acknowledgement by Company of the existence or extent of such Inventions, nor of Contractor\\u2019s ownership of such Inventions. Contractor further understands that Contractor must receive the formal approval of Company before commencing Contractor\\u2019s Relationship with Company. b. Use or Incorporation of Inventions.

The records may be in the form of notes, sketches, drawings, flow charts, electronic data or recordings, laboratory notebooks, or any other format. The records will be available to and remain the sole property of Company at all times. Contractor agrees not to remove such records from Company\\u2019s place of business except as expressly permitted by Company policy which may, from time to time, be revised at the sole election of Company for the purpose of furthering Company\\u2019s business. Contractor agrees to deliver all such records (including any copies thereof) to Company at the time of termination of the Relationship as provided for in Section 5 and Section 6. f.

This power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall not be affected by Contractor\\u2019s subsequent incapacity. g. Exception to Assignments. Subject to the requirements of applicable state law, if any, Contractor understands that Company Inventions will not include, and the provisions of this Agreement requiring assignment of inventions to Company do not apply to, any invention which qualifies fully for exclusion under the provisions of applicable state law, if any. Some examples of state laws limiting the scope of assignable inventions are: Delaware Code Title 19 Section 805; Kansas Statutes Section 44-130; Minnesota Statutes 13A Section 181.78; North Carolina General Statutes Article 10A, Chapter 66, Commerce and Business, Section 66-57.1; Utah Code Sections 34-39-l through 34-39-3, \\u201CEmployment Inventions Act\\u201D; Washington Rev. Code, Title 49 RCW: Labor Regulations, Chapter 49.44.140. Contractor acknowledges that to the extent one of the foregoing laws applies, Contractor\\u2019s invention assignment agreement will not apply to an invention for which no equipment, supplies, facility or trade secret information of Company was used and which was developed entirely on Contractor\\u2019s own time, unless: (1) the invention relates directly to the business of Company or to Company\\u2019s actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development; or (2) the invention results from any work performed by Contractor for Company. Similarly, to the extent California Labor Code Section 2870, or Illinois\\nDoc ID: 2a05783083fc8596a06cca54d66070d96995218d\\n765ILCS1060/1-3 or NY Labor Law \\u00A7 203-f controls, the same notice will apply absent the word \\u201Cdirectly\\u201D in part (1). In order to assist in the determination of which inventions qualify for such exclusion, Contractor will advise Company promptly in writing, during and after the term of the Relationship, of all Inventions solely or jointly conceived or developed or reduced to practice by Contractor in connection with, or as a result of, the Services performed for Company during the period of the Relationship.\\n5.

Contractor further agrees that any property situated on Company\\u2019s premises and owned by Company, including disks and other storage media, filing cabinets or other work areas, is subject to inspection by Company personnel at any time with or without notice. Contractor agrees that, at the time of termination of the Relationship, Contractor will deliver to Company (and will not keep in Contractor\\u2019s possession, recreate or deliver to anyone else) any and all devices, records, data, notes, reports, proposals, lists, correspondence, specifications, drawings, blueprints, sketches, laboratory notebooks, materials, flow charts, equipment, other documents or property, or reproductions of any of the aforementioned items developed by Contractor pursuant to the Relationship or otherwise belonging to Company, its successors or assigns.\\n6. Termination Certification. In the event of the termination of the Relationship, Contractor agrees to sign and deliver the \\u201CTermination Certification\\u201D attached hereto as Exhibit B; however, Contractor\\u2019s failure to sign and deliver the Termination Certification shall in no way diminish Contractor\\u2019s continuing obligations under this Agreement.\\n7. Notice to Third Parties. Contractor agrees that during the periods of time during which Contractor is restricted in taking certain actions by the terms of this Agreement (the \\u201CRestriction Period\\u201D), Contractor shall inform any entity or person with whom Contractor may seek to enter into a business relationship (whether as an owner, employee, independent contractor or otherwise) of Contractor\\u2019s contractual obligations under this Agreement. Contractor also understands and agrees that Company may, with or without prior notice to Contractor and during or after the term of the Relationship, notify third parties of Contractor\\u2019s agreements and obligations under this Agreement. Contractor further agrees that, upon written request by Company, Contractor will respond to Company in writing regarding the status of Contractor\\u2019s engagement or proposed engagement with any party during the Restriction Period. 8.

Other Parties. Contractor agrees that during the term of the Relationship, Contractor will not negatively influence any of Company\\u2019s clients, licensors, licensees or customers from purchasing Company products or services or solicit or influence or attempt to influence any client, licensor, licensee, customer or other person either directly or indirectly, to direct any purchase of products and/or services to any person, firm, corporation, institution or other entity in competition with the business of Company. In\\nDoc ID: 2a05783083fc8596a06cca54d66070d96995218d\\naddition, Contractor acknowledges that Company has valuable Trade Secrets (as defined by applicable law from time to time) to which Contractor will have access during the term of the Relationship. Contractor understands that Company intends to vigorously pursue its rights under applicable Trade Secrets law if, during a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of the Relationship for any reason, whether with or without cause, Contractor solicits or influences or attempts to influence any client, licensor, licensee, customer or other person either directly or indirectly, to direct any purchase of products and/or services to any person, firm, corporation, institution or other entity in competition with the business of Company. Thereafter, Company intends to vigorously pursue its rights under applicable Trade Secrets law as the circumstances warrant.\\n9. No Change to Duration of Relationship. Contractor understands and acknowledges that this Agreement does not alter, amend or expand upon any rights Contractor may have to continue in the relationship with, or in the duration of Contractor\\u2019s relationship with, Company under any existing agreements between Company and Contractor, including without limitation the Contractor Agreement, or under applicable law.\\n10. Representations and Covenants. a. Facilitation of Agreement. Contractor agrees to execute promptly, both during and after the end of the Relationship, any proper oath, and to verify any proper document, required to carry out the terms of this Agreement, upon Company\\u2019s written request to do so. b. No Conflicts. Contractor represents that Contractor\\u2019s performance of all the terms of this Agreement does not and will not breach any agreement Contractor has entered into, or will enter into, with any third party, including without limitation any agreement to keep in confidence proprietary information or materials acquired by Contractor in confidence or in trust prior to or during the Relationship. Contractor will not disclose to Company or use any inventions, confidential or non-public proprietary information or material belonging to any previous client, employer or any other party. Contractor will not induce Company to use any inventions, confidential or non-public proprietary information, or material belonging to any previous client, employer or any other party. Contractor agrees not to enter into any written or oral agreement that conflicts with the provisions of this Agreement.\\nContractor further represents that Contractor does not presently perform or intend to perform, during the term of the Contractor Agreement, consulting or other services for, and Contractor is not presently employed by and has no intention of being employed by, companies whose businesses or proposed businesses in any way involve products or services that would be competitive with Company\\u2019s products or services, or those products or services proposed or in development by Company during the term of the Contractor Agreement. If, however, Contractor decides to do so, Contractor agrees that, in advance of accepting such employment or agreeing to perform such services, Contractor will promptly notify Company in writing, specifying the organization to which Contractor proposes to render services, and provide information sufficient to allow Company to determine if such work would conflict with the interests of Company. c. Voluntary Execution. Contractor certifies and acknowledges that Contractor has carefully read all of the provisions of this Agreement, that Contractor understands and has voluntarily accepted such provisions, and that Contractor will fully and faithfully comply with such provisions.\\n11. Electronic Delivery. Nothing herein is intended to imply a right to participate in any of Company\\u2019s equity incentive plans, however, if Contractor does participate in such plan(s), Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to Contractor\\u2019s participation in Company\\u2019s equity incentive plan(s) by electronic means or to request Contractor\\u2019s consent to participate in such plan(s) by electronic means. Contractor hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agrees, if applicable, to participate in such plan(s) through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by Company or a third party designated by Company.\\nDoc ID: 2a05783083fc8596a06cca54d66070d96995218d\\n12.

This Agreement is incorporated into the existing agreements between Company and Contractor regarding Contractor\\u2019s services to Company, Company\\u2019s clients, and any other aspect of the relationship between Company and Contractor. The parties intend this Agreement to be consistent with any existing agreements between them. But unless specified otherwise in this Agreement, this Agreement takes precedence over any inconsistent term in any existing agreement between the parties. If any term of this Agreement conflicts with an existing agreement between the parties, this Agreement controls. The parties agree as follows:\\n1. Intent to Arbitrate. (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 6, Contractor and Company agree to first attempt to resolve any disputes or claims amicably and on an individual basis by providing 30 days written notice prior to filing any such dispute or claim. If the dispute or claim is not resolved amicably, and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Contractor and Company agree that to the fullest extent permitted by law, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES OR CLAIMS BETWEEN CONTRACTOR AND COMPANY will be exclusively resolved by final and binding arbitration by a neutral arbitrator, including without limitation any and all disputes or claims BETWEEN CONTRACTOR AND COMPANY, whether in contract, tort, statute, or otherwise, arising out of or relating to the formation (including unconscionability and invalidity), existence, breach, termination, interpretation, enforcement, validity, scope, and applicability of this Agreement, Contractor\\u2019s classification as an independent contractor, or Contractor\\u2019s engagement with Company, or any claim on any basis under federal, state, or local law, which could otherwise be heard before any court of competent jurisdiction arising out of or relating to this Agreement, Contractor\\u2019s classification as an independent contractor, or Contractor\\u2019s engagement with Company. By signing this Agreement, and unless otherwise stated in this Agreement, Contractor and Company hereby waive their right to have any covered dispute, claim, or controversy decided by a judge or jury in a court. Contractor and Company also understand and agree that Company\\u2019s business and Contractor\\u2019s services involve commerce under the Federal Arbitration Act. This Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \\u00A7\\u00A7 1 et seq.) even if Company and Contractor are otherwise exempted from the FAA. Any disputes or claims in this regard must be resolved exclusively by an arbitrator. In the event, but only in the event, there is a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that the FAA does not apply, the Delaware Uniform Arbitration Act will apply. Contractor and Company anticipate that by entering into this Agreement, the Parties will gain the benefits of a speedy and less expensive dispute resolution procedure. This Agreement shall encompass all disputes and claims that Company may have against Contractor, or that Contractor may have against Company and/or any of its officers, directors, employees, owners, agents, representatives, benefit plans, sponsors, fiduciaries, parents, subsidiaries, or affiliated entities (each of which may enforce this Agreement as a third party beneficiary, in addition to the third parties described in Section 4 below) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, Contractor\\u2019s classification as an independent contractor, or Contractor\\u2019s engagement with Company. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7, Contractor and Company agree that any third party at or in whose premises the Services under this Agreement may be performed, as well as any consumer reporting agency responsible for providing background check services of Contractor, are intended third party beneficiaries of this Agreement. For additional clarity, by signing this Agreement, Contractor and Company hereby expressly waive, to the extent permitted by applicable law, their right to have any dispute or claim resolved by a court unless specifically set out in this Agreement.\\n2. Delegation. Except as this Agreement otherwise provides, the arbitrability of any dispute between Contractor and Company, including whether or to what extent all or part of this Agreement is invalid, unconscionable, or otherwise unenforceable, and whether a dispute, claim, or controversy is\\nDoc ID: 2a05783083fc8596a06cca54d66070d96995218d\\nsubject to arbitration, is a decision that will be submitted exclusively to the arbitrator, and will not be decided by any federal or state court. Contractor and Company intend this delegation clause to be clear and unmistakable evidence of Contractor and Company\\u2019s agreement to delegate these issues to the arbitrator, subject to the exceptions stated in the Sections 5 and 6, which set forth that this delegation clause shall not apply to the Waiver of Class Action Claims and Waiver of Representative Action Claims.\\n3. Covered Claims. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the disputes and claims covered by this Agreement include any and all disputes and claims BETWEEN CONTRACTOR AND COMPANY arising out of or relating to this Agreement, Contractor\\u2019s classification as an independent contractor, or Contractor\\u2019s engagement with Company, which could otherwise be heard before a court of competent jurisdiction (a \\u201CClaim\\u201D), including but not limited to disputes or claims related to allegations of wrongful termination; breach of any contract or covenant, express or implied; breach of any duty owed to Contractor by Company or to Company by Contractor; personal, physical or emotional injury (excluding benefit claims covered under any applicable workers\\u2019-compensation law); fraud, misrepresentation, defamation, and any other tort claims; wages or other compensation due; penalties; benefits; reimbursement of expenses; discrimination or harassment, including but not limited to discrimination or harassment based on race, sex, color, pregnancy, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, or sexual orientation; retaliation; violation of any local, state, or federal constitution, statute, law, ordinance or regulation (as originally enacted and as amended), including but not limited to Fair Credit Reporting Act, Defend Trade Secrets Act, 42 U.S.C. \\u00A71981, Rehabilitation Act, Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1871, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, Equal Pay Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, Americans With Disabilities Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (except for claims for employee benefits under any benefit plan sponsored by Company and (a) covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or (b) funded by insurance), Affordable Care Act, Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act, Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, Older Workers Benefits Protection Act of 1990, Occupational Safety and Health Act, Immigration Reform and Control Act, Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, Family and Medical Leave Act, False Claims Act, and all other federal, state, or local statutory and legal claims arising out of or relating to Contractor\\u2019s relationship with Company (including without limitation misclassification claims) or the termination of that relationship (including without limitation torts and post-termination defamation or retaliation).\\nThis includes all claims that arose before the signing of this or any prior Agreement and any claims that may arise after the signing or termination of this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in Section 7. Covered Claims also include Third-Party Disputes as defined in Section 4.\\nA Claim under this Section also includes all claims or disputes between Contractor and any third party arising out of or related to the Services performed under this Agreement that may be brought against third party at or in whose premises the Services under this Agreement may be performed. A Claim also includes all claims or disputes between Contractor and a third party concerning the provision of any background check of Contractor by a consumer reporting agency. Any disputes or claims in this regard shall be resolved exclusively by an arbitrator.\\nA Claim arising under any law that requires resort to an administrative agency shall be brought before such agency as required by law, and that after exhaustion of administrative remedies, the Claim must be pursued through this binding arbitration procedure to the fullest extent permitted by law.\\nContractor agrees that each Claim covered under this Section must proceed in arbitration (except as otherwise provided in Sections 5, 6, and 7) even if the Claim is included or pleaded in the same\\nDoc ID: 2a05783083fc8596a06cca54d66070d96995218d\\ncomplaint, case, or proceeding with a dispute or claim that is not covered by this Agreement as described in Section 7.\\n4. Application to Third Parties. This Arbitration Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall include, any dispute, controversy, or claim brought by or against any third parties where the underlying claims arise out of or relate to this Agreement, Contractor\\u2019s classification as an independent contractor, or Contractor\\u2019s engagement with Company (\\u201CThird Party Disputes\\u201D). Third Party Disputes include any dispute, controversy, or claim against: (1) any business partners or contracting parties of Company; (2) any clients of Company; and (3) Company\\u2019s vendors and service providers including without limitation: (a) payment processors; (b) identity verification vendors; (c) any third party involved in the provision of any background check of Contractor by a consumer reporting agency; and (d) other partners assisting in fraud prevention. Third Party Disputes shall also include any dispute, controversy, or claim by or against Contractor\\u2019s spouses, heirs, third-party beneficiaries, and assigns. For avoidance of doubt, a Claim under this Agreement includes all claims or disputes between Contractor and third party arising out of or related to the services performed by Contractor in the course of Contractor\\u2019s engagement with Company. Any disputes or claims in this regard shall be resolved exclusively by an arbitrator, and the Parties agree that third parties described in Section 4 are third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement and have the right to enforce this Agreement (including but not limited to filing a motion to compel arbitration) for Third Party Disputes.\\n5. Waiver of Class Action Claims. By signing this Agreement, Company and Contractor agree that each may bring and pursue claims against the other only in their individual capacities, and may not bring, pursue, or act as a plaintiff, class representative, or class member in any purported class or collective proceeding or action. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the applicable arbitration rules under the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution (\\u201CCPR\\u201D) or ADR Services, Inc. (as described below): (1) Any claim that all or part of this Waiver of Class Action Claims is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable shall be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) If the waiver set forth in this Section is found to be unenforceable, any class or collective action claims will be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction and not as a class or collective arbitration; and (3) If applicable law permits a party to elect to invalidate the waiver set forth in this Section as to certain types of claims, and such party\\u2019s election renders the waiver set forth in this Section unenforceable as to such claims, any class or collective action for such claims will be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction and not as a class or collective arbitration.\\n6. Waiver of Representative Action Claims. By signing this Agreement, Company and Contractor agree that each may bring and pursue claims against the other only in their individual capacities, and may not bring, pursue, or act as a plaintiff or representative in any purported representative proceeding or action or otherwise participate in any such representative proceeding or action. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the applicable arbitration rules under CPR or ADR Services, Inc. (as described below): (1) Any claim that all or part of this Waiver of Representative Action Claims is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable shall be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (2) If all or part of the waiver set forth in this Section is found to be unenforceable, any representative action claims will be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction and not as a representative arbitration, but any arbitrable individual portion of any representative action shall be arbitrated under Section 9 of this Agreement.\\n7. Claims Not Covered. This Agreement does not apply to litigation between Contractor (as a party or actual or prospective class member) and Company pending in a state or federal court or arbitration as of the effective date of Contractor\\u2019s receipt of this Agreement. Claims not covered by this\\nDoc ID: 2a05783083fc8596a06cca54d66070d96995218d\\nAgreement are claims for workers\\u2019 compensation benefits; claims for unemployment compensation benefits; or any other claims that as a matter of controlling law cannot proceed in arbitration, provided that controlling law is not preempted by the FAA. For claims alleging a sexual harassment dispute or sexual assault dispute as defined by 9 U.S.C. \\u00A7\\u00A7 401 and 402, if the party alleging such claims elects to proceed with such claims in court instead of arbitration (\\u201CElectable Claims\\u201D): (1) upon a valid and timely election by the party to not proceed in arbitration for such Electable Claims, such Electable Claims may be litigated in a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction and need not proceed in arbitration; and (2) if an Electable Claim is included or pleaded in the same complaint, case, or proceeding with other Covered Claims that do not allege conduct constituting a sexual harassment dispute or a sexual assault dispute (\\u201CNon-Electable Claims\\u201D), that shall not prevent the Non-Electable Claims from being severed from the Electable Claims and proceeding in arbitration pursuant to this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement prohibits Contractor from exercising rights protected under the National Labor Relations Act or from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, Securities and Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board, or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. Nothing in this Agreement prevents the investigation by a government agency of any report, claim, or charge otherwise covered by this Agreement. Disputes or claims between Company and any third-party beneficiaries are not covered by the terms of this Agreement.\\n8. Arbitration Procedures and Forum. Except as described below for Contractors providing Services in California, by signing this Agreement, Contractor and Company further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted before one neutral arbitrator selected by the Parties as provided by the CPR Administered Arbitration Rules (https://drs.cpradr.org/rules/arbitration/administered-arbitration-rules-2019) and, if applicable, the CPR Employment-Related Mass-Claims Protocol (https://static.cpradr.org/docs/ERMCP-2021.pdf) (collectively, the \\u201CCPR Rules\\u201D). The arbitration shall be conducted under the CPR Rules then in effect. Contractor may obtain a copy of the CPR Rules by requesting a copy from Company or by accessing CPR\\u2019s website at www.cpradr.org and searching, or using other websites to search, for \\u201CCPR Administered Arbitration Rules\\u201D and \\u201CCPR Employment-Related Mass-Claims Protocol.\\u201D By signing this Agreement, Contractor acknowledges that Contractor has had an opportunity to review the CPR Rules before signing this Agreement. If CPR is not available to hear the matter in dispute, Contractor and Company shall confer and agree upon a mutually agreeable arbitral forum. The unavailability of CPR or any other arbitral forum shall not be a basis to invalidate the Parties\\u2019 agreement to arbitrate. If for any reason Contractor and Company cannot agree to an arbitral forum, either party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction with authority over the location where the arbitration will be conducted for appointment of a neutral arbitrator.\\n9. California Contractor Arbitration Rules. For any Contractor providing Services in California, Contractor and Company agree that any arbitration will be conducted before one neutral arbitrator selected by the Parties as provided by the rules of ADR Services, Inc. (\\u201CADR Services Rules\\u201D). The arbitration will be administered by ADR Services, Inc. and conducted under the ADR Services Rules then in effect. Contractor may obtain a copy of the ADR Services Rules by requesting a copy from Company or by accessing ADR Services, Inc.\\u2019s website at https://www.adrservices.com/services/arbitration-rules. By signing this Agreement, Contractor acknowledges that Contractor has had an opportunity to review the ADR Services Rules before signing this Agreement. If ADR Services is not available to hear the matter in dispute, Contractor and Company will confer and agree upon a mutually agreeable arbitral forum. The unavailability of ADR Services or any other arbitral forum is not a basis to invalidate the Parties\\u2019 agreement to arbitrate. If for any reason Contractor and Company cannot agree to an arbitral forum, either party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction with authority over the location where the arbitration will be conducted for appointment of a neutral arbitrator.\\nDoc ID: 2a05783083fc8596a06cca54d66070d96995218d\\n10. Location. The arbitration shall be held in the United States county where Contractor lives or performs services or in any other location Contractor and Company agree upon in writing.\\n11. Arbitration Fees, Attorney\\u2019s Fees, and Costs. Contractor and Company will follow the CPR Rules or ADR Services Rules applicable to initial filing fees, but in no event will Contractor be responsible for any portion of those fees in excess of the filing or initial appearance fees applicable to court actions in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be conducted. After Contractor pays Contractor\\u2019s portion of any initial filing fee, Company must pay any remaining portion of the initial fee and must also pay all costs and expenses unique to arbitration, including, without limitation, the arbitrator\\u2019s fees and any of CPR or ADR Services Inc.\\u2019s arbitration administrative expenses. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, \\u201Carbitration fees\\u201D) will be governed by the applicable CPR Rules or ADR Services Rules and the laws of the jurisdiction in which Contractor performed Services. In all cases required by law, Company will pay the full amount of the arbitration fees. Any disputes in that regard will be resolved by the arbitrator as soon as practicable after the arbitrator is selected, and Company will bear all of the arbitration fees until such time as the arbitrator resolves any such dispute. Contractor may be represented by counsel during any arbitration proceeding. Each party will pay its own costs and attorney\\u2019s fees, subject to the arbitrator\\u2019s ability, described in Section 12, to award costs and attorney\\u2019s fees to the extent such a remedy would have been available to the parties had the matter been heard in a court.\\n12. Awards. The arbitrator is authorized to award only those remedies or relief available under applicable law and that the arbitrator deems just and equitable, including any remedy or relief that would have been available to the parties had the matter been heard in a court, except that this Section 12 does not encompass, permit, or authorize any remedy or relief awarded on a class-wide, collective, or representative basis. The decision of the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall provide the findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the award unless Contractor and Company agree otherwise.\\n13. Provisional Relief. Contractor or Company may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy in accordance with applicable law, but only upon the ground that the award to which the applicant may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual without provisional relief and there is insufficient time to seek such provisional relief in arbitration. And any such application may not be deemed incompatible with or a waiver of this agreement to arbitrate, and preliminary relief sought in such application is subject to and limited by Sections 4 and 5. The court to which the application is made is authorized to consider the merits of the arbitrable controversy to the extent it deems necessary in making its ruling, but only to the extent permitted by applicable law. All determinations of final relief, however, will be decided in arbitration.\\n14. Opt-Out for Agreement.\\n(a) Contractor has 30 calendar days from the date Contractor signs this Agreement to opt-out of the Agreement. However, opting-out of this Agreement does not affect any other part of this Agreement. If Contractor opts out of the Agreement, then neither Contractor nor Company will be bound by the terms of this Agreement. Should Contractor not opt out in accordance with this Section 14 within the 30-day period, then this Agreement will become fully effective and binding as of the date the Agreement is executed by Contractor. If Contractor agreed to a previous arbitration agreement with Company and opts out of this Agreement, Contractor remains bound by that prior arbitration agreement and must arbitrate any and all claims or disputes covered by that prior arbitration agreement, regardless of whether those claims or disputes arise after the date Contractor executes this Agreement.\\nDoc ID: 2a05783083fc8596a06cca54d66070d96995218d\\n(b) To opt out, within 30 days from the date Contractor signs this Agreement, Contractor must notify Company in writing of Contractor\\u2019s intent to opt-out of the Agreement by providing Contractor\\u2019s first and last name and a clear statement of Contractor\\u2019s intent to opt out such as \\u201CI wish to opt-out of the Agreement\\u201D or words to that effect. The written intent to opt out must be provided either by: (1) sending electronic mail to legal@committedcoaches.com; or (2) by sending a letter by U.S. Mail, or by any nationally recognized delivery service (e.g. Federal Express, UPS), or delivered by hand to:\\nP.O. Box 4573 El Dorado Hills 95762\\n(c) In order to be effective, the letter under option (2) must be dated and signed by Contractor and the envelope containing the signed letter must be received (if delivered by hand) or post-marked within 30 days of the date you sign this Agreement. Contractor\\u2019s written intent to opt-out of the Agreement, whether sent by (1) or (2), will be maintained by Company, and Contractor is encouraged to retain a copy for Contractor\\u2019s records.\\n15.
